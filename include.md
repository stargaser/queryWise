This application plots the positions of infrared-detected stars and galaxies
from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey catalog. The brightnesses are expressed in
magnitudes, where a higher numerical magnitude is a fainter source.

You may choose four input parameters:

* **Right Ascension** -- this is latitude on the sky, and must be between 0 and 360 degrees. 
* **Declination** -- this is latitude on the sky, and must be between -90 and +90 degrees.
* **Box size** -- this is the size of the search box in arcminutes. 60 arcminutes equals
one degree. The diameter of the full moon is 30 arcminutes.
* **Wavelength** -- this is the center wavelength of the observation, ranging from
3.5 to 22 microns. For reference, the wavelength of yellow light is about 0.5 microns.
